I developed the introduction section with a dropdown navigation menu of a landing page. The most technical part of this project was setting up the dropdown navigation menu. It challenged me to think deeply and I also had to develop this project with little use of bootstrap. I learned how to set my navigation button from scratch without the use of bootstrap.

I would also like to acknowledge and appreciate front end mentor for the files used in the development of this project.
